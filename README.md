## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware, a prominent manufacturer of computer hardware in India and other countries, faces challenges in making timely and informed decisions based on data. To address this, the management plans to expand its data analytics team by recruiting additional junior data analysts. A SQL challenge was initiated as part of the hiring process to assess candidates' proficiency in technical skills as well as their ability to demonstrate soft skills.

## Tools and Concepts Used

- **MySQL**
  - **SQL Techniques**: Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Subqueries, Window Functions, String Functions, Numeric Functions, Date Functions, and more.
- **Power BI**
  - **Data Modeling**: Tables connected through data modeling.
  - **Visuals Used**: Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart, Metrics Table, Microsoft Azure Maps.
  - **DAX Measures Created**: Applied DAX for custom calculations.
- **Canva**
  - **Presentation**: Created visually appealing slides for showcasing findings.

## Key Concepts

- **SQL Basics: Data Retrieval - Single Table**
  - Installing MySQL on different operating systems and importing datasets.
  - Querying data with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `DISTINCT`, `LIKE`, and numeric filters like `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `ORDER BY`.
  - Using summary functions such as `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, and the `HAVING` clause.
  - Calculated columns with `IF`, `CASE`, `YEAR`, and `CURYEAR`.

- **SQL Basics: Data Retrieval - Multiple Tables**
  - Overview of SQL joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL`.
  - Introduction to `CROSS JOIN` and joining multiple tables.

- **SQL Basics: Complex Queries**
  - Implementing subqueries, `ANY`, `ALL` operators, and correlated subqueries.
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs), their benefits, and practical applications.

- **SQL Basics: Database Creation & Updates**
  - Understanding database normalization, primary and foreign keys, and data integrity.
  - Working with different data types: numeric, string, date, JSON, and spatial.
  - Creating a database from an ERD, importing data from CSV, and managing data with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

- **AtliQ Hardware & Business Model**
  - Concepts of relational vs. No-SQL databases, ETL, OLAP vs. OLTP, fact vs. dimension tables, and schema designs.

- **SQL Advanced: Finance Analytics**
  - Developing user-defined functions and stored procedures for financial reporting.
  - Analyzing product transactions and market performance using SQL functions and views.

- **SQL Advanced: Top Customers, Products, Markets**
  - Generating reports with database views for pre-invoice discounts and net sales.
  - Utilizing window functions (`OVER`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`) for customer and market insights.

- **SQL Advanced: Supply Chain Analytics**
  - Understanding supply chain basics and creating helper tables.
  - Implementing database triggers, events, temporary tables, and indexes for performance optimization.

## Key Learnings

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into the practical use of SQL for business analytics, from extracting data to generating complex reports and visualizing insights. The hands-on experience allowed me to:

1. Efficiently manage data retrieval and complex queries using MySQL, applying techniques like joins, CTEs, and window functions.
2. Design and optimize databases, ensuring data integrity and high performance for querying.
3. Use Power BI to create interactive visualizations that support data-driven decision-making.
4. Present findings effectively using Canva, enhancing my ability to communicate data insights to stakeholders.
