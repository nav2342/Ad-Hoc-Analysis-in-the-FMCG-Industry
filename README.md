## Problem Statement

NexaBites, a prominent manufacturer of computer hardware in India and other countries, faces challenges in making timely and informed decisions based on data. To address this, the management plans to expand its data analytics team by recruiting additional junior data analysts. A SQL challenge was initiated as part of the hiring process to assess candidates' proficiency in technical skills as well as their ability to demonstrate soft skills.

## Tools and Concepts Used

- **MySQL**
  - **Advanced SQL Querying**: Utilized JOINS, CTEs, Subqueries, and Window Functions to extract actionable insights from large datasets.
  - **Aggregation & Performance Optimization**: Applied GROUP BY, HAVING, and Indexing to improve query efficiency and execution time.
  - **Financial & Sales Analysis**: Queried gross sales, pre-invoice deductions, and revenue trends to support strategic decision-making.

## Key Concepts

- **SQL Basics: Data Retrieval - Single Table**
  - Installing MySQL on different operating systems and importing datasets.
  - Querying data with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `DISTINCT`, `LIKE`, and numeric filters like `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `ORDER BY`.
  - Using summary functions such as `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, and the `HAVING` clause.
  - Calculated columns with `IF`, `CASE`, `YEAR`, and `CURYEAR`.

- **SQL Basics: Data Retrieval - Multiple Tables**
  - Overview of SQL joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL`.
  - Introduction to `CROSS JOIN` and joining multiple tables.

- **SQL Basics: Complex Queries**
  - Implementing subqueries, `ANY`, `ALL` operators, and correlated subqueries.
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs), their benefits, and practical applications.

- **SQL Basics: Database Creation & Updates**
  - Understanding database normalization, primary and foreign keys, and data integrity.
  - Working with different data types: numeric, string, date, JSON, and spatial.
  - Creating a database from an ERD, importing data from CSV, and managing data with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

- **Database Concepts & Business Model**
  - Concepts of relational databases, ETL, OLAP vs. OLTP, fact vs. dimension tables, and schema designs.

- **SQL Advanced: Finance Analytics**
  - Developing user-defined functions and stored procedures for financial reporting.
  - Analyzing product transactions and market performance using SQL functions and views.

- **SQL Advanced: Top Customers, Products, Markets**
  - Generating reports with database views for pre-invoice discounts and net sales.
  - Utilizing window functions (`OVER`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`) for customer and market insights.

- **SQL Advanced: Supply Chain Analytics**
  - Understanding supply chain basics and creating helper tables.
  - Implementing database triggers, events, temporary tables, and indexes for performance optimization.

## Key Learnings

  - Strengthened SQL expertise, including stored procedures and views for data automation.
  - Gained FMCG domain knowledge, focusing on key financial and operational metrics.
  - Improved data storytelling and visualization for executive reporting.


## Conclusion

This project enhanced my SQL skills and ability to extract actionable insights from data. It deepened my understanding of business metrics and their role in decision-making. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects to drive business growth and operational efficiency.
